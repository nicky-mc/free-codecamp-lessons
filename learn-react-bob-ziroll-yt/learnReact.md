in this folder I will be following a comprehensive React tutorial by freeCodeCamp, led by Bob Ziroll, emphasizes hands-on learning through coding challenges and projects designed to help beginners effectively grasp React concepts.

Although I've a good understanding of most concepts I find embedding the basics reinforces my skills and understanding.

I'll be adding my own learning notes over time. (though these will be a bit behind the coding side of things) so that I have a record of my own understanding that makes sense to me as well as allowing others to use my notes to improve upon their own skills or to learn from start if that's where you are.

Anywhere I've put my own spin on things on any of the projects I'll ensure to fully explain what I did and how it works and why I went "off piste" as it were/

#### Key Takeaways

*   **Structured Learning:** The course consists of six sections, each ending with a practical project to reinforce learned concepts.
    
*   **Fundamental Concepts:** Key topics include JSX, components, props, state management, and event handling, vital for building React applications.
    
*   **Hands-On Projects:** Projects range from a static page ("ReactFacts") to interactive apps like a recipe generator and a dice game, allowing practical application of skills.
    
*   **Capstone Experience:** The final two projects serve as capstones, challenging learners to apply all they have gained in building more complex applications like a hangman-style game.
    
*   **Bonus Resources:** A section on helpful VS Code extensions supports developers in their React journey.
    
*   **Focus on Accessibility:** The tutorial integrates best practices for making web applications accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
